The app will be implemented in both React Native and iOS Native.

	•	admin: Can log into application. Can add/edit/delete tourist attractions. Can view different statistics about regular users through charts (e.g. the tourist attractions preferred by different users by location). 
	•	regular user: Can sign up. Can log into application. Can request a new password by email (if forgotten. Can see a list of famous tourist destinations by location and category(where to eat/drink/visit) and details(pictures, exact location, ratings, menu/reviews for restaurants etc) about them upon selection. When selecting an item a chart showing the ages of the users who prefer it is also shown. Users will be notified when a new location is added nearby.

	•	The native iOS application
  
It will use ARKit to display information about a tourist attractions directly on screen when the user walks around and views the locations through the phone camera(ex: the name and rating of a restaurant, the artist of a famous sculpture etc). Another idea is leaving messages and pictures for contacts to see when they visit that place. A notification could be sent to the user when this scenario occurs.
The user will be able to see a map of the places he has visited and add pictures, notes, recording etc (travel diary).
